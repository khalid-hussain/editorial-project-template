# Preface {.unnumbered}

Loans have to be paid back one day. Had this been realized by all, how nice life
would have been on this Planet. It would not have prompted the poet to say
“Neither be a Lender, nor a Borrower Be.” Alas! Given the realities in life,
this could remain at best a wishful thinking.

So their business is to lend and lend more. Their proficiency; skill; competency
are all tested in how much they lend and how much they \SC{recover} and how
quickly. Suffice it would be to state that this can be likened to the vigour and
strength with which one goes about after fully recovering from any ailment. It
is agreed by al beyond doubt “Recovery” is essential and get “recovery” is very
essential.

We know right form the appraisal stage up to the actual repayment stage the
banks need to be careful. We also know that once the money is in the hands of a
borrower, attitudinal changes take place. The borrower, with some few exceptions
may be, feels a bit more complacent as after all it is not this “own money”
which is at stake. Therefore an attempt is made here to put all that we know
already proper perspective.
