# Introduction {.unnumbered}

How many times, since I left Lebanon in 1976 to live in France, have people
asked me, with the best intentions in the world, whether I felt “more French” or
“more Lebanese”? And I always give the same answer: “Both!” I say that not in
the interests of fairness or balance, but because any other answer would be a
lie. What makes me myself rather than anyone else is the fact that I am poised
between two countries, two or three languages and several cultural traditions.
It is precisely this that defines my identity. Would I exist more authentically
if I cut off a part of myself?

To those who ask the question, I patiently explain that I was born in Lebanon
and lived there until I was 27; that Arabic is my mother tongue; that it was in
Arabic translation that I first read Dumas and Dickens and Gulliver's Travels;
and that it was in my native village, the village of my ancestors, that I
experienced the pleasures of childhood and heard some of the stories that were
later to inspire my novels.
